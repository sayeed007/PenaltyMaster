# PenaltyMaster
This was my first project done during my second year of undergraduate.
Itâ€™s a small football related game. 
A football lover always wants to score. 
The main purpose of the game is to shoot in perfect time and location. 
A target is moving on the goal-post. A goal contains 100 points. 
If you can shoot the target you will get 300 points as a bonus. 
Totally you can hit 5 times on the ball. The total points will be your score. 
If your point is equal to high score then it will be the high score for the game. 
You can also reset the high score. 
So hitting on the target is the main purpose of the game. 
I hope it will be enjoyable.
